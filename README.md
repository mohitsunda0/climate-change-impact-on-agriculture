# Climate Impact on Agriculture
This project investigates the effects of climate change on agriculture, exploring factors such as temperature, rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events. The aim is to provide insights into how climate variations impact crop yields and suggest adaptation strategies for sustainable farming.
## Features
- Analysis of temperature and rainfall trends.
- Impact of extreme weather events on crop yields.
- Visualizations of climate and agricultural data.
- Suggestions for mitigation and adaptation strategies.
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- R (for advanced statistical analysis)
- Dataset: Climate and agricultural data from [source name].
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/climate-impact-agriculture.git
   cd climate-impact-agriculture
